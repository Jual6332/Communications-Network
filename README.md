# Communications-Network
A C++ application for transmitting messages from coast to coast along a linked list of nodes

## Running the application:
- To run the app, load the project file "Assignment4.cbp" in CodeBlocks::IDE software
- Set the program's arguments to include the Message file "messageIn.txt"
- This file can be changed to reflect any message, which will be transmitted across all cities
- Build and run the application, and a command line menu will show up
- Follow the necessary prompts, remembering to build the network first
